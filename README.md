# DEPLOY-PYTHON-ML


Basic machine learning (ML) project to illustrate steps to deploying to AWS Lambda using Docker.

## Data Science Process

Some super basic data science/machine learning project. I basically went on Kaggle, looked up "nlp dataset" and downloaded the first one with sufficient data. Then I copied and pasted old code on here.

## How do I build the model?

`python build_model.py`

## How do I test the app?

`RUNNING_LOCAL=True python -m app.main`
